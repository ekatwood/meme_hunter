# Token Quest

A GraphQL query that searches for the most unique trades of a token recently, helping you find trending tokens without doing heavy research.

Progress so far: https://meme-hunter-4f1c1.web.app/

TODO:

Buy a custom domain

Make the query every hour

Switch Ethereum to Arbitrum

Add charts

Add a copy button for the token's mint address

Add a token display page with all the information including metadata, with a widget to facilitate a swap using Jupiter API for Solana and 1inch API for Arbitrum. Website charges a $0.20 fee for each swap.

Re-issue the query apikey and web app apikey and store them in Firebase or Google Cloud so this project can remain open source.
