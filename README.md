# meme_hunter

A GraphQL query that searches for the most unique trades of a token recently, helping you find trending tokens without doing heavy research.

TODO:

Buy a custom domain

Make the query every hour

Remove Ethereum (until they fix transaction fees)

Add matplotlib charts

Add a copy button for the token's mint address

Design a smart wallet using Rust that auto-buys new trending tokens every hour. It sends you an email if it runs out of capital, or you can just check it.

Re-issue the query apikey and web app apikey and store them in Firebase or Google Cloud so this project can remain open source.
